## Project: ONLINE EXAMINATION SYSTEM

### Description
> The Online Examination System is a software designed to facilitate exam administration and management. It provides a secure examination environment and handles various tasks related to conducting exams. 

### Modules

1. **Login System**: Users access the system through a secure login system protected by passwords.
  
2. **Question Pool Management**: The system allows administrators to create a pool of questions. During the test, random questions are generated from this pool.

3. **Test Navigation**: Candidates can navigate between different questions and sections while attempting the test.

4. **Answer Tracking**: The system records answers given by the candidates along with the corresponding questions.

5. **Test Evaluation and Grading**: After completion, the system evaluates the test responses and calculates grades based on predefined criteria.

6. **Certificate Generation**: Upon successful completion of the test, the system generates certificates for the candidates.

7. **Admin Panel**: Administrators have access to an admin panel for managing users, questions, tests, and generating reports.
