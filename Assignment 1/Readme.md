## Project: SELECTION  SORT VISUALIZER

### Description:
> This project aims to implement selection sort and visualize the intermediate steps creatively, focusing on comparisons and swapping elements. Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element from the unsorted portion of the array and moves it to the sorted portion.

### Milestones

#### Milestone 1: Overall Plan
- **Objective:** Create a comprehensive plan outlining the software's structure and functionality.
- **Tasks:** 
  - Determine the scope and requirements of the sorting software.
  - Design the user interface for displaying intermediate steps.
  - Plan the algorithm implementation strategy.
  
#### Milestone 2: Algorithm Implementation
- **Objective:** Implement selection sort algorithm using code.
- **Tasks:**
  - Write the code for selection sort algorithm in the chosen programming language.
  - Ensure that the implementation is efficient and correctly sorts the input array.
  - Develop a mechanism to visualize the intermediate steps of the sorting process.
  
#### Milestone 3: Full Implementation
- **Objective:** Achieve a fully functional sorting software with visualization.
- **Tasks:**
  - Integrate the algorithm implementation with the visualization mechanism.
  - Test the software thoroughly to ensure correct functionality and visual appeal.
  - Address any bugs or issues encountered during testing.
  - Finalize documentation and prepare for deployment.

### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the software.
3. Input the array to be sorted.
4. Visualize the intermediate steps of the sorting process.
5. Obtain the sorted array as the output.
